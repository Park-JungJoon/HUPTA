# HUPTA
HUPTA, a web application for profile of human protein-coding genes quantifying their tissue-specificity, housekeeping ability.

## Gene Profile

+ The profile of a gene's tissue specificity, house keeping ability, and constitutive expression can be seen through a series of statistically calculated scores.
+ We collected 46,813 samples from three databases, GEO, GTEx, and TCGA, and obtained consensus on gene profiles.
+ Additionally, We provide promoter information from the EPD.

## Dataset download
+ By adjusting statistical parameters such as coefficient of variation, TAU, and fold change, users can download genes with the desired tissue specificity.

## Web Application requirments for local running.
See requirement.txt.
