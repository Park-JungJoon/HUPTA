# Tissue Specific Gene

We devise TS score which is constinous, quantitative and statistical score of a gene's tissue specificity based on massive high-throughput sequencing.

## Work flow
1. Low expression gene pre-filtering (GeTMM 1)
2. Caculate Tau and Fold change in each database
3. Z-score normalization of all Tau and FC
4. Average of Z-score normalized Tau, FC

#### TS score
+ TS score distribution
