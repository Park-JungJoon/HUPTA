# Constitutive expressed gene

+ CS score is a quantitative and statistical measure of the level of constitutive expression of a gene.
+ Difference between housekeeping gene is that HKG must have small variation even if the gene is expressed above a certain level in all samples, while constitutive expression genes are above a certain level and no further variation is considered.
+ To calculate the CS score, genes with expression levels in the upper third quartile for each sample were marked as 1, genes with expression in the bottom first quartile marked as 0.
